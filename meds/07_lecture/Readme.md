# Olsen now discovers, on closer examination of the construction drawings, that the bricks in his house have s= 0,01 S/m. (See problem 15.1. We have 𝜖! = 4)

## a. Set up a new transmission line analogy.

## b. Calculate the field strength in Olsen’s living room.

# Suggested course of action:

## 1. Decide which model to use.

## 2. Determine the relevant h, g, and l.

## 3. Determine K& and K(x).

## 4. Calculate field strengths and power densities.
